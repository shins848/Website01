                I should have known from the start
                There would be a day where things would change, babe
                It's just that I gave you my heart
                Thinking you would stay but you walked away

                It didn't have to be confusing
                You said you needed a little bit more space
                Instead you went with him
                The least you could've done was say it to my face, baby

                I'm not saying that you're mine but
                Don't be wasting my time
                Confusing me like we'd get back together
                And then you were my ride or die but
                Leave me for a new guy
                I guess that I was wrong about forever

                Callin' but you hit decline
                Only time will tell if you're someone else
                It's just that I gave you my time
                But you closed the book and put it on the shelf

                It didn't have to be confusing
                You said you needed a little bit more space
                Instead you went with him
                The least you could've done was say it to my face, baby

                I'm not saying that you're mine but
                Don't be wasting my time
                Confusing me like we'd get back together
                And then you were my ride or die but
                Leave me for a new guy
                I guess that I was wrong about forever
                
                I'm not saying that you're mine but
                Don't be wasting my time
                Confusing me like we'd get back together
                And then you were my ride or die but
